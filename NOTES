    Raphe has interneurons, which are inhibitory in nature.
    On average inhibition from interneurons are balanced by excitation by LHB.

    I am putting 15 interneurons and 15 raphe neurons. On average, each
    interneuron is making 3 synapses onto each raphe neurons. If each excitatory
    synapse is 1.62 mV then lhb -> raphe should have (9 / 1.62) * 3 = 16.7
    connections i.e. with probability 16.7 / N = 100 .
